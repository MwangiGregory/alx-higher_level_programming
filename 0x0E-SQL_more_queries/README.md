# SQL - More queries
In this project I learnt about some more sql functionality such as:

* Creating users and granting priviledges.
* MySQL constraints.
* How to use query data from multiple tables using Join.
* Database design and data modelling.
* Normalization to come up with Atomic tables.
* ER Modelling.
